<p>Happy New Year all my folks, family, friends. You know it's 2020. That means your sight will be 20:20 to see what your
dreams look like or to harvest it. Don't fear to dare your dreams. Your father never sleeps. Just call him and show him
like you do for your best friend. I want this and I want that. Any thing you pray you will get it by the end of the
year. Most of you will get your answer before the half season ends. God bless you all.  <p/>
